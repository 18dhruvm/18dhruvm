## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Dhruv here
I am a highly motivated and curious individual with a strong passion for computer science, data science, and 
machine learning. I have acquired expertise in data analysis, statistical modelling, and machine learning 
through internships and independent projects, and I am keen to learn more during my time at the University 
of Southern California.
Apart from my love for computers, I am an explorer who wants to try out different things and activities, 
challenge myself to new tasks and environments, forge new friendships and learn about the new cultures 
that our world offers.
